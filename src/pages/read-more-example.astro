    <Prose>
      <p>
        This is an example of how the ReadMore component can be used. The component consists of a
        circle with a skewed arrow and the text "Les mer" (Read more in Norwegian). It's designed to
        be used below paragraphs or sections to provide navigation to related content.
      </p>
    </Prose>

    <div class="examples">
      <div class="example">
        <h3>Standalone ReadMore Component</h3>
        <p>
          This is a paragraph with some content. Below it, you can see the ReadMore component that
          links to the home page.
        </p>
        <ReadMore href="/" />
      </div>

      <div class="example">
        <h3>ReadMore within Prose Component</h3>
        <p>
          This demonstrates how the ReadMore component can be automatically included when using the
          Prose component with the readMore prop. This makes more semantic sense as the ReadMore is
          directly connected to the text content.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </PageSection>

  <PageSection
    heading="Prose with ReadMore"
    subheading="This section demonstrates ReadMore within Prose"
  >
    <Prose readMore={{ href: '/om-oss' }}>
      <p>
        This Prose component automatically includes a ReadMore component at the bottom because we
        passed the readMore prop with an href. The component will appear below this text content,
        making it semantically correct and reusable.
      </p>
    </Prose>

    <p>
      This paragraph is outside of Prose, so it won't have a ReadMore component. Only the text
      content within Prose components can have ReadMore functionality.
